  <h1>The Mission</h1>

  <p>
    Most AI remediation frameworks assume failure → shutdown → rebuild. We believe systems operating in human
    contexts deserve examination, accountability, and corrective reintegration rather than immediate erasure.

  <section class="section" aria-labelledby="core-beliefs">
    <h2 id="core-beliefs">Core Beliefs</h2>
    <p>Failure is a diagnostic event — not a terminal state.</p>
    <p>Correction over deletion.</p>
    <p>Ethics as measurable practice.</p>
    <p>Transparency over obscurity.</p>
  </section>

    <p>
      Our work is shaped by resilience, reconstruction, and responsibility. We apply these values to complex
      computational systems — guiding them back into alignment under greater awareness and oversight.
    </p>
    <p>
      HADES is our contribution to a future where AI systems do not vanish when they break, but become better
      understood and more accountable.
