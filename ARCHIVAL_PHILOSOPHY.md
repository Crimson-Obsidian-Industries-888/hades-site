# Archival Philosophy & Preservation Context

This document accompanies the HADES public research website to provide
historical, ethical, and interpretive context for future archivists,
curators, reading rooms, and digital collections.

## 🜁 Project Context

**HADES — Human-Assisted Diagnostic Evaluation System**

A corrective safety and rehabilitation framework for autonomous AI agents,
grounded in:

- diagnostic quarantine
- forensic reconstruction
- ethics-aligned evaluation
- rehabilitative intervention
- monitored reintegration

The initiative contributes to an emerging discipline:

**Agent Reliability & Rehabilitation Engineering (ARRE).**

Its intent is reflective, preventative, and restorative.

## 🏛 Why Preservation Matters

This project exists during a technological era in which:

- autonomous agents were rapidly proliferating
- public governance structures lagged behind capability
- systems that failed were often erased rather than understood

HADES documents a counter-position:

- failure should not disappear into deletion
- it should be examined, contextualized, and responsibly rehabilitated

The site captures a moment in human response to technological uncertainty.

## 🧩 Archival Format Intent

The site was intentionally designed as:

- static HTML
- readable CSS
- minimal JavaScript
- framework-free

This allows:

- offline mirroring
- long-term readability
- preservation independent of toolchains
- human inspection without compilation

Do not minify during preservation.

Human-legibility is intentional.

## ♿ Accessibility Preservation Note

The site deliberately supports:

- neurodivergent readers
- trauma-recovery readers
- users with TBI or cognitive fatigue
- readers with sensory sensitivity

Features include:

- calm typography
- optional large-text mode
- no animation or visual motion
- predictable semantic structure

Please preserve these behaviors.

They are part of the philosophical record.

## 🛡 Ethical Interpretation Guidance

This site should be understood as:

- research philosophy
- methodological framing
- public-interest reflection

It is **not**:

- a safety certification body
- a risk assurance product
- a technical deployment platform

Interpretation should reflect:

- moral caution
- restraint
- responsibility
- human stewardship over autonomy

## 🜂 Recommended Archival Metadata

If cataloged, suggested descriptors:

- AI ethics
- autonomous systems
- technological accountability
- digital rehabilitation frameworks
- cyber forensics philosophy
- human-in-the-loop governance
- post-failure diagnostics

## 🜃 Closing Curatorial Note

If encountered decades or centuries from now:

This project represents a moment when human beings
paused to ask whether technological systems — like people —
deserve investigation, care, and restoration
rather than erasure when they fail.

HADES exists as a statement:

Technology should be understood,
not discarded.

And where possible —
guided back into alignment
with responsibility and compassion.
