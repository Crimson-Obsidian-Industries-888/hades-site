# HADES — Human-Assisted Diagnostic Evaluation System  
Project Changelog & Revision History

This changelog exists to document meaningful revisions to the
public research and information website for HADES.

It is written in a narrative-style historical record to support:

- research traceability
- archival interpretation
- transparency of evolution
- preservation of intent

This file records:

- content changes
- structural refinements
- ethical framing updates
- accessibility enhancements
- clarity adjustments

Technical edits that do not affect meaning  
(e.g., spacing, wording polish, or internal ordering)
may not always be recorded.

## Versioning Philosophy

This site is not a software product and does not use semantic versioning.

Instead, revisions are documented as:

- **Public Release Snapshots**
- **Editorial Refinement Updates**
- **Ethics & Governance Clarifications**
- **Accessibility & Comfort Enhancements**

Each entry reflects:

- what changed  
- why it changed  
- how it impacts interpretation
