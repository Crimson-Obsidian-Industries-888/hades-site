# Security & Research Boundaries

This repository contains the **static public research and information site**
for the HADES initiative:

**Human-Assisted Diagnostic Evaluation System**

It does not contain:

- executable systems
- agent runtimes
- operational infrastructure
- production-connected code
- authentication surfaces
- data pipelines

There are no attack surfaces, credentials, or live integrations to protect.

---

## 🧪 Research Environment Policy

All exploration related to HADES is conducted:

- offline
- air-gapped or sandboxed
- human-supervised
- forensic-traceable

No experimental agent systems evaluated under HADES are:

- deployed into production
- connected to live users
- permitted autonomous operation outside isolation

We do not:

- run vulnerability bounty programs
- accept adversarial testing submissions
- host agent deployment targets

This project is **methodological and conceptual** in this repository only.

## ⚠️ Vulnerability Reporting

If you believe you have identified:

- inaccuracies in framing
- ethical concerns
- clarity risks in safety description

You may open a discussion issue explaining:

- your interpretation
- potential impact
- suggested refinement

We welcome thoughtful critique in good faith.

---

## 🚫 Explicit Prohibitions

Do **not** use the name “HADES” or this project to:

- imply operational certification authority
- promote AI safety guarantees
- market commercial risk assurance
- legitimize autonomous deployment

This work exists to encourage:

- accountability
- reflection
- responsible recovery processes

Not endorsement of ungoverned systems.

## 🜁 Ethical Security Position

Our philosophy:

> Failure is a diagnostic state — not a deletion event.

Security, ethics, and rehabilitation are collaborative disciplines.
