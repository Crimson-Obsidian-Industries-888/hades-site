# Contributing to HADES — Human-Assisted Diagnostic Evaluation System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HADES project.

This repository represents the **public research and information website** for the HADES initiative. It is designed to communicate:

- methodology
- governance
- ethical framing
- research direction
- safety philosophy

It is **not a commercial project** and does not accept contributions related to:

- productization
- growth or marketing language
- hype or speculative framing
- deployment of experimental systems

This work prioritizes responsibility, clarity, and ethical restraint.

## 🧭 Contribution Principles

Contributions should:

- maintain accessibility and cognitive comfort
- preserve calm, disciplined presentation
- value clarity over technical cleverness
- minimize complexity
- avoid animations, motion, or overstimulation
- respect the reflective tone of the project

This project exists for:

- research transparency
- academic dialogue
- public-interest understanding

## 👁 Accessibility & Care Commitments

This project is intentionally designed to support:

- neurodivergent users
- users with visual strain or sensory overload
- users recovering from TBI
- users with cognitive fatigue

Do not introduce:

- harsh contrasts
- visual noise
- movement
- distracting UI patterns

Comfort and dignity come first.

## 🧱 Code & Content Style

All content should remain:

- semantic HTML
- readable CSS
- minimal, purposeful JavaScript
- static and framework-free

We avoid:

- build tools
- dependency chains
- dynamic application behavior

Static sites endure — and can be archived, mirrored, and preserved.

## 🛡 Ethics & Safety Boundaries

This project must not be used to:

- promote unregulated agent deployment
- encourage adversarial experimentation on live users
- claim safety guarantees
- imply certification authority

HADES is a **corrective research framework**, not a governance body.

Please open a pull request that:

1. includes full-file edits (no fragmented partials)

## 🜁 Stewardship Philosophy
